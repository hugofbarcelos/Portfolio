            As a Frontend Developer, Iâ€™ve always loved to play computer games, and with that I started to
            gain interest in trying to understand how everything worked software
            wise. With these values in mind, I ventured into what was the
            unknown for me, the programming world. There, I discovered the
            thrill of solving difficult challenges that got me to the next
            knowledge dimension.
